# Basic

This example shows the basic usage of *azula*.

 - A window gets created
 - Console messages coming from the GUI get routed to Node using [onconsolemessage](https://github.com/maierfelix/azula#windowprototypeonconsolemessage)
 - A basic HTML file gets loaded using [loadHTML](https://github.com/maierfelix/azula#windowprototypeloadhtml)
 - An update loop gets created and runs as long as the window is active
